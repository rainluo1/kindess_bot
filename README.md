Here is a sample of the bot interacting with its users. 

2. To creat this bot I utilized dicord.py API. The bot would scan eacch messages, check if any abusive language is used.

3. In the furture, I hope to make imporvements to the bot my by detecting abusive from images, and being able to detect NSFW images. I would like to implement a feature that allows members to vote and decide if they accept the language used by the offender is appropriate.
